# This repository contains implementation of various Data structures and Algorithms using Python
## The main aim is to implement the various data structures using a systematic strategic that is:
# 1.Stating the problem clearly and identifying the input and output formats,
# 2.Coming up with some example inputs and outputs and attempt to cover all edge cases.
# 3.Coming up with a correct solution for the problem .
# 4.Implimenting the solution and test it using example inputs while trying to fix bugs(if any).
# 5.Analyzing the algorithm's complexity, identify inefficiencies and try to overcome the inefficiency using the right technique.
